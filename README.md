Audio Feature Classification using Decision Trees

A comprehensive ML pipeline for binary classification of audio signals using decision tree algorithms. The dataset contains 20 acoustic features:

• Statistical measures: meanfreq, sd, median, Q25, Q75, IQR, skew, kurt
• Spectral features: sp.ent, sfm, centroid, modindx
• Fundamental frequency: meanfun, minfun, maxfun
• Dominant frequency: meandom, mindom, maxdom, dfrange

Features include:
✅ Decision Tree implementation with scikit-learn
✅ Feature importance analysis and visualization
✅ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
✅ Decision tree visualization (graphical and text rules)
✅ Handling of imbalanced datasets
✅ Model evaluation and comparison

Ideal for voice classification, speaker identification, or general audio ML tasks.
