Machine learning project using decision trees to classify audio signals based on 20 acoustic features. Includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Features
- Decision Tree implementation with hyperparameter tuning
- Feature importance analysis for audio characteristics
- Interactive decision tree visualization
- Model performance evaluation metrics

## Quick Start
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/audio-decision-trees.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
python train_model.py
